The conversation of who is the greatest NBA player of all time has to be one of the most discussed topics in the sports world. Without bias on who was your favorite player as a kid, I’m hoping statistics can help settle one part of this argument.

## First Step

The first thing I wanted to do was start with was all time leaders in pints. Defense is just as important as offence but scoring is usually the most recorded stat for players.

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the all time leading scorer in NBA history with 38,387 points. He played 20 seasons winning the Most Valuable Player 6 times, and is a 6 NBA Champion.

Kareem Abdul Jabbar is without a doubt one of the greatest to ever play. The only reason for doubt comes from the era he played in. As a rookie in 1970 the average height was 6’5” (78 inches). Kareem was 7’2” (86 inches) his whole career. This height advantage can be the reason why he was able to score as many points as he did.
Would he have scored as many points in today’s NBA as he did in the 70’s and 80’s?

Karl Malone is second in all time points scored with 36,928. In 19 seasons he was a 2 time season MVP, and one of the most durable players to ever step foot on an NBA court. Although he dominated in points , he never won an NBA finals, which takes him out of the contention for GOAT.

The next two people are Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. They were both 6’6”, played the same position and weighed 2 pounds apart. Michael Jordan was a 6 time NBA champion, 5 time league MVP , and 9 time member of the All-Defensive team. Kobe Bryant was a 5 time NBA champion, 1 time league MVP, and 12 time member of the All-Defensive team.

Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant are two of the three all time great Shooting guards to play in the NBA. Another great 6’6” Shooting guard was charles barkley. These three are the only people to lead in points, rebounds, steals and assists for 6’6” guards. Stats combined, Kobe bryant leads the other two in points and assists, Jordan leads in steals and Barkley leads in rebounds.

These histograms show a side by side comparisoon of thier carreer toals for points, rebounds, assists, and steals. An importnat thing to note is that Kobe Bryant played 20 NBA seasons and Michael Jordan only played 15. With that being said does more of a specific stat nessiciarilly mean better comapred to one another.
