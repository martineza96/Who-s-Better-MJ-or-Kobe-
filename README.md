# Who-s-Better-MJ-or-Kobe-
The conversation of who is the greatest NBA player of all time has to be one of the most discussed topics in the sports world. Without bias on who was your favorite player as a kid, I’m hoping statistics can help settle one part of this argument.

## First Step

The first thing I wanted to do was start with was all time leaders in pints. Defense is just as important as offence but scoring is usually the most recorded stat for players. 

![](img/Most%20Points%20in%20NBA%20History.png)

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the all time leading scorer in NBA history with 38,387 points. He played 20 seasons winning the Most Valuable Player 6 times, and is a 6 NBA Champion.

Kareem Abdul Jabbar is without a doubt one of the greatest to ever play. The only reason for doubt comes from the era he played in. As a rookie in 1970 the average height was 6’5” (78 inches). Kareem was 7’2” (86 inches) his whole career. This height advantage can be the reason why he was able to score as many points as he did.
Would he have scored as many points in today’s NBA as he did in the 70’s and 80’s?

## Second Best in Points
Karl Malone is second in all time points scored with 36,928. In 19 seasons he was a 2 time season MVP, and one of the most durable players to ever step foot on an NBA court. Although he dominated in points , he never won an NBA finals, which takes him out of the contention for GOAT.

## Kobe and MJ
The next two people are Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. They were both 6’6”, played the same position and weighed 2 pounds apart. Michael Jordan was a 6 time NBA champion, 5 time league MVP , and 9 time member of the All-Defensive team. Kobe Bryant was a 5 time NBA champion, 1 time league MVP, and 12 time member of the All-Defensive team.

Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant are two of the three all time great Shooting guards to play in the NBA. Another great 6’6” Shooting guard was charles barkley. These three are the only people to lead in points, rebounds, steals and assists for 6’6” guards. Stats combined, Kobe bryant leads the other two in points and assists, Jordan leads in steals and Barkley leads in rebounds.

These histograms show a side by side comparisoon of thier carreer toals for points, rebounds, assists, and steals. An importnat thing to note is that Kobe Bryant played 20 NBA seasons and Michael Jordan only played 15. With that being said does more of a specific stat nessiciarilly mean better comapred to one another.

## Man-Whittney Tests
To compare the two , the Mann-Whitney test allowed an uneven amount of samples to be compared to each other to prove or disprove a null hypothesis. The null hypothesis for all of these tests was ‘MJ would have less of the stat than Kobe’. As shown by the p-value, every one of these tests null hypothesis was rejected, proving that MJ was the better player in all categories.

## Why not LeBron James?
Whether you know basketball or not, there is a high chance you have heard the name LeBron James.
The reason he wasn’t  chosen as the main player was because the dataset only went to 2018 and LeBron is still actively playing in the NBA. 
Kobe Bryant was a great player, statistically not better than Jordan, but what about LeBron?

This scatter plot shows the total points scored for Michael Jordan's career and LeBron James career up until 2018. The  box plot shows the average amount of assists per game they had for the same timeframe as mentioned above. As we seen with the points , having more doesn't necessarily mean better.

## LeBron vs Jordan Mann-Whittney Test

When performing these tests I decided to keep the same null hypothesis as before ’MJ would have less of the statistic than Lebron James’.  Starting with the points statistic , it started to look like familiar territory.  The p value was extremely low so the null hypothesis was rejected. When compared in assists however it was the complete opposite and we failed to reject the null hypothesis. To break the tie, blocks were compared to each other and although MJ had more comparison wins, we still fail to reject the null hypothesis, giving LeBron the tie.

# Conclusion


In conclusion there have been great players to play the game of basketball. All individually great in their own respective play styles and positions. What people care about is who is the greatest player of all time. To get to that conclusion there will have to be many tests of comparisons that need to be done. Comparing Kobe Bryant to Michael Jordan, there's no doubt that Michael Jordan is better. With LeBron playing an additional 3 years than the data at hand, and also recently winning his 4th NBA championship, the question is still yet to be answered. MJ or LeBron?
